# Apache Wave Contributing

Latest information can be found [here](https://incubator.apache.org/wave/community/contributing)

## Our Process

Contributions to the Wave codebase should be sent as GitHub pull requests. 

1) Fork the repo using the Github gui.
2) Make your changes
3) Submit a pull request to the main repo listing any JIRA issues that may be 
related.
4) Wait for the Apache Wave team to review the request and approve it.

## Language

Eventually the website and the Apache Wave client will need to be translated and
to do this we will need a large contribution from members around the world to 
keep the project upto date. Once this process has begun we will replace this
with instructions on how to process the i18n format files.
